We have 2 test case files as an example in the tests folder, inside this folder we have 2 sub-folders called Feature and Unit.
These are the 2 types of testing that is carried out during the development of any project.

Tools for testing:

PHPunit, Mockery, PHPSpec, Storyplayer

Laravel has PHPunit already integrated within

PHPunit:
It is a framework that is used for unit testing. A unit testing is a way to see how small peices of code will be tested against 
expected results.

Feture testing is method for checking how indivisual units of code will work together in pass a message

Regression testing is a method for seeing how the user interacts with the application and make sure that the app will not stop

HTTP testing where simple HTTP requests are sent like GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE

Authenticating responses is used when we have to test authentication and authorization

Database tests where tools and assertions are tested to make it easier to test database driven applications

Commands to run in terminal for testing:

./vendor/bin/phpunit 

php artisan test (my choice)

Create a new test:
php artisan make:test Your_Test_Case_Name

php artisan make:test Your_Test_Case_Name --unit ------> a test case file inside the unit folder
